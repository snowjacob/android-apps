## Projects
* [Checklist App for Android](ChecklistApp)
  * This project aims to create a simple checklist application for Android devices. It allows you to create and manage a to-do list easily. 

### Installation Instructions

To install the demo app on your Android device, you'll need to enable USB debugging. Here's how you can do it:

1. Enable Developer Options: Go to your device's settings, then navigate to "About Phone" or "Software Information." Find the "Build Number" entry and tap it seven times until you see a message that says "You are now a developer!"

2. Enable USB Debugging: Now that you have enabled Developer Options, go back to the main settings screen, and you should see a new option called "Developer Options." Open it and toggle on "USB Debugging."

3. Connect your Device: Connect your Android device to your computer using a USB cable.

4. Install the App: Once USB debugging is enabled and your device is connected, you can build and install the app on your device using Android Studio or the command line.

### Resources

If you're new to USB debugging and need more information, you can refer to the official Android documentation on [Enabling USB Debugging](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options).
